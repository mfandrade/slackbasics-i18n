<bridgehead>Linux HOWTO's</bridgehead>

<para>
The famous Linux HOWTOs are a collection of documents which
cover specific parts of a GNU/Linux system. Most HOWTOs are
distribution independent, and therefore very useful for using
them with Slackware Linux. The "linux-howtos" package in
from the "f" diskset contains the HOWTO collection. After
installing this package the HOWTOs can be found in
the <filename>/usr/doc/Linux-HOWTOs/</filename> directory.
Slackware also contains a collection of Mini-HOWTOs, which
are shorter and cover narrower topics. The Mini-HOWTOs can
be found in the <filename>/usr/doc/Linux-mini-HOWTOs/</filename>
directory after installing the "linux-mini-howtos" package.

<bridgehead>alt.os.linux.slackware</bridgehead>

<para>
alt.os.linux.slackware is a Slackware Linux newsgroup. You can read
newsgroups with a newsreader like tin or knode. Be careful: it is
expected that you have read all necessary documentation before posting
to this newsgroup. If you have not the chance of getting "flamed"
is really big.
