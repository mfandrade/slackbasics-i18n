Slackware Linux Basics

* Installation *

The source XMLs can be compiled into other formats (HTML, PDF, ...)
using the "linuxdoc-tools" and "libxslt" packages, which can be found
in the ap/ and l/ package directories respectively. FOP is required
to create PDF files from XSL:FO output.

Execute "make" to generate HTML and PDF files. If you do only want to
generate the HTML files execute "make fmt-html" and
"make fmt-html-singlepage".
