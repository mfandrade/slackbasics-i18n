  <para>
    This book aims to provide an introduction to Slackware Linux. It
    addresses people who have little or no GNU/Linux experience, and
    covers the Slackware Linux installation, basic GNU/Linux commands
    and the configuration of Slackware Linux. After reading this book,
    you should be prepared to use Slackware Linux for your daily work,
    and more than that. Hopefully this book is useful as a reference
    to more experienced Slackware Linux users as well.

    Thanks to the rapid development of open source software, there are
    now comprehensive desktop environments and applications for
    GNU/Linux. Most current distributions and books focus on using
    GNU/Linux with such environments. I chose to ignore most of the
    graphical applications for this book, and tried to focus this book
    on helping you, as a reader, to learn using GNU/Linux in a more
    traditional UNIX-like way. I am convinced that this approach is
    often more powerful, and helps you to learn GNU/Linux well, and
    not just one distribution or desktop environment. The UNIX
    philosophy is described in <link xl:href="#chap-intro-unix">the
    overview of UNIX philosophy</link>

    I wish everybody a good time with Slackware Linux, and I hope that
    you will find this book is useful for you.
