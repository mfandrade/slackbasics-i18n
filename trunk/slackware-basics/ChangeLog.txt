- Replace occurences of "Slackware", "Slackware Linux", and 
  "Slackware GNU/Linux" with the "Distribution" entity. Replace
  occurences of "GNU/Linux" with the "OS" entity. Replace
  occurences of "Linux" with the "Kernel" entity. This will
  improve naming consistency in the guide. 
- Mark up some acronyms with <acronym>. Use an italic font for
  acronyms.

  "Network configuration" and IPsec chapters to the "Network

- Add the useradd command to usermgmt.xml, and move this chapter
  to the "System administration" part.
- Switched from the GNU Free Documentation License to a BSDL-like
  license. My motivation for this is that BSD-style licenses are
  much easier to read and interpret. And it provides more freedom
  (though some people would argue with that ;)).

- Generate textutils.xml by default.
- Add sections about echo and cat to textutils.xml.

- Add the "make lint" target, which helps checking the validity
  of the XML files.

- Fix two errors in the CSS stylesheet for HTML output.
- Use tidy to clean up the resulting HTML files, and let tidy
  convert these to XHTML 1.0 Transitional.

Wed Nov 3 23:20:44 CET 2004
- Added a unified DSSSL stylesheet for "html" and "print" outputs, 
  slackware-basics.dsl.
