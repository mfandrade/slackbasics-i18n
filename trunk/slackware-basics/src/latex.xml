    <para>
      LaTeX is a typesetting system that can be used to produce high-quality
      articles, books, letters and other publications. LaTeX is based on
      TeX, a lower-level typesetting language that was designed by Donald
      E. Knuth. LaTeX does not work like a <acronym>WYSIWYG</acronym>
      (what you see is what you get) word processor, the kind of document
      preparation system most people are accustomed to. With LaTeX you
      do not have to care about formatting the document, only about writing
      the document.
    </para>

    <para>
      LaTeX files are plain-text files that contain LaTeX macros. LaTeX
      formats the document based on the macros that are used. In the
      beginning using LaTeX may be a bit awkward to a new user. But after
      a while you will discover that using LaTeX has some distinct
      advantages. To name a few:

        <para>
          You do not have to care about the layout of your documents. You
          just add structure to your documents, and LaTeX takes care of
          the formatting.

        <para>
          LaTeX files are plain text, and can easily be changed using
          standard UNIX tools, such as <command>vi</command>,
          <command>sed</command> or <command>awk</command>

          LaTeX provides very good support for typesetting things like
          mathematical formula, references and Postscript images.

    <para>
      LaTeX is very extensive, so this chapter will only touch the
      surface of LaTeX. But it should be enough to get you started
      to be able to make simple documents.

    <sect2 id="editing-latex-basic-minimal">
      <title>Minimal document structure</title>

      <para>
        Each LaTeX document has some basic minimal structure that
        describes the document. Let's look at an example:
      </para>

      <screen>
\documentclass[10pt,a4paper]{article} <co id="latex-struct-1" />

\title{The history of block ciphers} <co id="latex-struct-2" />
\author{John Doe} <co id="latex-struct-3" />

\begin{document} <co id="latex-struct-4" />

This is a basic document. <co id="latex-struct-5" />

\end{document} <co id="latex-struct-6" />
      </screen>

      <para>
        You can already see the basic syntactical structure of LaTeX
        commands. A command is started with a backslash, followed by the
        name of the command. Each macro has a mandatory argument that
        is placed in accolades, and an optional argument that is placed
        in square brackets.
      </para>

      <calloutlist>
        <callout arearefs="latex-struct-1">
          <para>
            The first command in every document is the
            <emphasis>documentclass</emphasis>. This command specifies
            what kind of document LaTeX is dealing with. The type of
            document is specified as a mandatory parameter. You can
            also specify some optional parameters, such as the font
            size and the paper size. In this case the font size is changed
            from the default 12pt to 10pt, and A4 is used as the
            paper size. The document classes that are available in
            LaTeX are shown in <xref linkend="latex-documentclasses" />.
          </para>
        </callout>
        <callout arearefs="latex-struct-2">
          <para>
            After the documentclass you can add some meta-information
            to the document, like the title of the document. In this
            case the title is <emphasis>The history of block
            ciphers</emphasis>.
          </para>
        </callout>
        <callout arearefs="latex-struct-3">
          <para>
            The author command specifies the author of the book.
          </para>
        </callout>
        <callout arearefs="latex-struct-4">
          <para>
            The <emphasis>\begin</emphasis> command marks the beginning
            of an environment. There are many different environments,
            but they all implicate certain typesetting conventions for the
            text that is in an environment. In this case we start an
            <emphasis>document</emphasis> environment. This is a very
            basic environment, LaTeX interprets everything in this
            environment as the body of the text.
          </para>
        </callout>
        <callout arearefs="latex-struct-5">
          <para>
            The content of the document can be placed within the
            <emphasis>document</emphasis>, in this case a friendly
            warning about the nature of the document.
          </para>
        </callout>
        <callout arearefs="latex-struct-6">
          <para>
            All environments eventually have to be closed. The
            <emphasis>document</emphasis> environment is the last
            environment that is closed, because it denotes the end
            of the body of the text.
          </para>
