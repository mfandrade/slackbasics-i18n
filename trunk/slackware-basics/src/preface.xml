This book aims to provide an introduction to &Distribution;. It addresses
people who have little or no GNU/Linux experience. It aims to cover the 
&Distribution; installation, basic GNU/Linux commands and the configuration
of &Distribution;. As you can see the book is still work in progress, but
the first bits are released in the <quote>release early, release often</quote>
spirit.

This book was written by Dani&euml;l de Kok and

It is continually under development,
not just to keep up with the latest &Distribution; versions, but also
to refine the documentation, and extend it where it is deemed
necessary.

I wish everybody a good time with &Distribution;, and I hope
