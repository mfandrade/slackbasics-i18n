<para>
This book aims to provide an introduction to Slackware Linux. It addresses
people who have little or no GNU/Linux experience. It aims to cover the 
Slackware Linux installation, basic GNU/Linux commands and the configuration
of Slackware Linux. As you can see the book is still work in progress, but
the first bits are released in the <quote>release early, release often</quote>
spirit.

I wish everybody a good time with Slackware Linux, and I hope
