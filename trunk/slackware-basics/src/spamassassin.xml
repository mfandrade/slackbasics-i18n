    <para>
      Spam E-Mail is one of the major problems of the current Internet. 
      Fortunately there are some tools which can help you reducing the 
      amount of spam you get. One of them is using blacklists. A blacklist 
      is a list of known open e-mail relays. With a blacklist you can 
      block e-mails which are sent using one of these open relays. 
      Unfortunately there are a few problems with this method, first of 
      all the database of open relays can never be complete. Besides that 
      some spam is sent using normal ISP-specific SMTP servers.

    <para>
      Another method is scanning the incoming e-mails for common 
      characteristics of spam. This method is comparable with a virus 
      scanner; a filter program knows a large number of spam 
      characteristics and gives each characteristic found in a mail a 
      point. If a defined number of points is exceeded the mail is 
      marked as spam. Spamassassin is that kind of filter.

    <sect2 id="spamassassin-install-html-parser">
      <title>HTML::Parser</title>
      
      <para>
        Spamassassin requires the HTML::Parser Perl package. The sources 
	of this package can be downloaded from CPAN. You can get the latest 
	version at the following URL: 
	<ulink url="http://search.cpan.org/dist/HTML-Parser/" />. We want 
	to install this package system-wide, so be sure to execute the 
	following instructions as the root user (or only the <command>make 
	install</command> step if you prefer). First of all you have to 
	extract the source archive, for example:
      </para>

      <screen>
# <command>tar zxf HTML-Parser-3.33.tar.gz</command>
      </screen>

      <para>
        In these examples you have to substitute the version number (3.33) 
	with the version number of the package you downloaded. After 
	extracting the archive go to the <filename>HTML-Parser-3.33</filename> 
	directory and configure, compile and install HTML::Parser with the 
	following commands:
      </para>

      <screen>
# <command>perl Makefile.PL</command>
# <command>make</command>
# <command>make install</command>
      </screen>

    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="spamassassin-install-spamassassin">
      <title>SpamAssassin</title>

      <para>
        After installing HTML::Parser the Slackware system is ready to 
	configure and install Spamassassin. This first step is, as always, 
	to download the sources. The SpamAssassin source can be downloaded 
	from: <ulink url="http://www.spamassassin.org/" />. Extract the 
	archive (use the version number of your SpamAssassin sources):
      </para>

      <screen>
# <command>tar zxf Mail-SpamAssassin-2.60.tar.gz</command>
      </screen>

      <para>
        And go to the <filename>Mail-SpamAssassin-2.60</filename> and execute 
	the following commands:
      </para>

      <screen>
# <command>perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/usr SYSCONFDIR=/etc</command>
# <command>make</command>
# <command>make install</command>
      </screen>

      <para>
        The <parameter class="command">PREFIX</parameter> parameter is used 
	to make sure that the SpamAssassin files are installed under the 
	<filename>/usr</filename> directory and the 
	<parameter class="command">SYSCONFDIR</parameter> parameter specifies 
	that the configuration files should be stored in 
	<filename>/etc</filename>.
      </para>
      
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="spamassassin-install-spamd">
      <title>Starting spamd</title>

      <para>
        It is not a bad idea to start a daemonized version of SpamAssassin 
	which runs in the background. This will speed up mail filtering. 
	The daemon can be started using the following command:
      </para>

      <screen>
# <command>spamd -c -d</command>
      </screen>

      <para>
        It is a good idea tot add this to <filename>/etc/rc.local</filename>, 
	so <command>spamd</command> will automatically be started during the 
	initialization process.
      </para>
      
    </sect2>
    
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="spamassassin-procmail">
    <title>Using spamassassin with procmail</title>

    <para>
      Sendmail will use procmail automatically on the default Slackware 
      installation if procmail is installed. Procmail is a program which 
      processes e-mails and allows you to apply filters. At first we are 
      going to have a look at how to add spamassassin headers to a 
      processed e-mail, after that we are going to look at a method to 
      separate spam from normal e-mail.
    </para>

    <sect2 id="spamassassin-procmail-marking">
      <title>Marking messages as spam</title>

      <para>
        The first step is to mark messages as either spam or non-spam. 
	Create a <filename>/etc/procmailrc</filename> file, if you do not 
	already have one. This is the system-wide procmail configuration 
	file, and applies to all incoming e-mails. Use the 
	<filename>~/.procmailrc</filename> file if you want to enable spam 
	marking for an individual account. Add the following lines to the 
	configuration file:
      </para>

      <screen>
:0 fw
* &lt; 256000
| /usr/bin/spamc -f
      </screen>

      <para>
        The first line says we want to pipe all messages to an external 
	command. The second line makes sure only messages smaller than 
	256000 bytes are filtered. Spam messages are usually not that 
	large, and adding this line can decrease the system load. Finally, 
	the third line specifies that the messages should be piped 
	through <command>/usr/bin/spamc</command> with the 
	<parameter>-f</parameter> parameter.
      </para>

    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="spamassassin-procmail-moving">
      <title>Moving spam mail to a separate mailbox</title>

      <para>
        Procmail can also be used to move spam to a separate mailbox 
	file. It is not a bad idea to configure this on a user basis, 
	because some users might want to use the filters of their e-mail 
	program to separate spam. In the following example we will move 
	spam messages to the <filename>~/mail/spam</filename> mailbox 
	file. To do this add the following lines to 
	<filename>~/.procmailrc</filename>:
      </para>

      <screen>
MAILDIR=$HOME/mail

:0:
* ^X-Spam-Status: Yes
spam
      </screen>

      <para>
        First of all MAILDIR is defined, this will create and use the 
	mailboxes in <filename>~/mail/</filename>. In the next two lines 
	we say that we want to filter out e-mails with the 
	<emphasis>X-Spam-Status: Yes</emphasis> header, which is added by 
	spamassassin if it believes an e-mail is spam. Finally the mailbox 
	to which the e-mails should be moved is specified.
      </para>
