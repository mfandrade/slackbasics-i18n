    <title>What is &Kernel;?</title>

    <para>
      &Kernel; is a Unix-like kernel which is written by Linus
      Torvalds and other developers, who communicate using the
      internet. &Kernel; runs on many different architectures, for
      example on many IA32, IA64, Alpha, m68k, SPARC and PowerPC
      machines. The latest kernel and more information can be found
      at: <ulink
      url="http://www.kernel.org">http://www.kernel.org</ulink>
    </para>

    <para>
      &Kernel; is often confused with the &OS; system. &Kernel; is
      only a kernel, not a complete operating system. &OS; consists of
      the GNU operating system with the &Kernel; kernel. Please read
      the following section for a more detailed explanation of &OS;.

    <title>What is &OS;?</title>

    <para>
      At the beginning of the eighties Richard Stallman started an
      ambitious project with the goal to write a free Unix-like
      operating system. The name of this system is
      <acronym>GNU</acronym> (GNU is Not Unix). At the beginning of
      the nineties most important components of the GNU oparating
      system were written, except for the kernel, which is still under
      development under the name HURD. HURD consists of some servers
      which provide Unix-like kernel functionality. In turn these
      servers run under the Mach microkernel.  At the beginning at the
      nineties the HURD team still had to wait till the Mach sources
      were released as free software. In the meanwhile Linus started
      filling the gap with the &Kernel; kernel. &OS; thus refers to
      the GNU system running on the &Kernel; kernel. Right now the
      HURD kernel is also in a usable state and can be downloaded in
      the form of the GNU/HURD operating system. The <ulink
      url="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</ulink> project has even
      developed a version of the GNU operating system which works with
      the <ulink url="http://www.netbsd.org/">NetBSD</ulink>
      kernel. We should call <quote>&Kernel; distributions</quote>
      <quote>&OS; distributions</quote>, because GNU is a substantial
      part of most distributions.

    <title>What is &Distribution;?</title>

    <para>
      &Distribution; is a &OS; distribution which is maintained and
      developed by Patrick Volkerding. In contrast to many other
      distributions &Distribution; adheres to the so-called KISS (keep
      it simple stupid) principle.  This means that &Distribution;
      does not have complex graphical tools for configuring a
      system. For newbies this can be somwhat harsh, but it provides
      more transperancy and flexibility. Besides that you will get to
      learn &OS; to the bones with &Distribution;.
    </para>

    <para>
      Another distinguishing aspect of &Distribution;, that also
      <quote>complies</quote> with the KISS principe is the
      &Distribution; package manager. &Distribution; does not have
      complex package manager like RPM. Packages are normal tgz
      (tar/gzip) files, mostly with an additional installation script
      and a package description. Tgz is much more powerful than RPM
      for novice users and avoids dependency problems. Another famous
      feature of &Distribution; are the BSD-like initialization
      scripts of &Distribution;. &Distribution; has one initialization
      script for each runlevel insteas of a script for eacht
      daemon. It allow you to tweak with your system easily, without
      the need to write net init scripts yourself.
    </para>

    <para>
      The packages in &Distribution; are compiled with as little
      modifications as possible. This means you can use most general
      &OS; documentation.

            <emphasis role="bold">&Kernel; 2.4.29</emphasis> -
            &Distribution; uses the proven 2.4 Linux kernel as the
            default kernel.  &Distribution; 10.1 provides &Kernel;
            2.6.10 as an option. When a 2.6 kernel is booted,
            &Distribution; will automatically use
            <emphasis>udev</emphasis>, which is a daemon that
            automatically generates <filename>/dev</filename> device
            entries.

    <title>&Distribution; on CD-ROM</title>

    <para>
      &Distribution; can be purchased at quite many (internet)
      shops. It is important to make a distinction between the
      official CD-ROM set and cheap copies. When you buy the official
      CD set you are financially supporting the development of
      &Distribution;. So, if you would like to see continuing
      development of &Distribution;, buy the CD set!  The Slackware
      Store can be found at: <ulink url="http://store.slackware.com/" />
