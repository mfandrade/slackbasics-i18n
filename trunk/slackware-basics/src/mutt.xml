    <para>
      Mutt is a mail user agent (<acronym>MUA</acronym>) that can be used
      for reading and writing e-mail. Mutt is a text-mode installation,
      meaning that it can be used on the console, over SSH and in an X
      terminal. Due to its menu interface, it is very easy to read large
      amounts of e-mail in a short time, and mutt can be configured to
      use your favorite text editor.
    </para>

    <para>
      This chapter will discuss how you can customize mutt for your needs,
      how to use it, and how PGP/GnuPG support is used.

  <sect1 id="email-mutt-usage">
    <title>Usage</title>

    <para>
      Mutt is pretty simple to use, though it may take some time to get
      used to the keys that are used to navigate, read and write e-mails.
      The next few sections describe some of the more important keys. Mutt
      provides a more thorough overview of available keys after pressing
      the &lt;h&gt; key.

    <sect2 id="email-mutt-usage-browsing">
      <title>Browsing the list of e-mails</title>
      
      <para>
        After invoking the <command>mutt</command> command, an overview
        of all e-mails will show up. You can browse through the list of
        e-mails with the up and down arrow keys, or the &lt;k&gt; and
        &gt;j&gt; keys. 
      </para>

    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="email-mutt-usage-reading">
      <title>Reading e-mails</title>
      
      <para>
        To read an e-mail, use the &lt;Enter&gt; key, after selecting an
        e-mail in the overview of e-mails.
        When reading an e-mail you can use the &lt;Page Up&gt; and
        &lt;Page Down&gt; to browse through an e-mail. You can still use
        the navigational keys used to browse the list of e-mail to browse
        to other e-mails.
      </para>

      <para>
        If an e-mail has any attachments, you can see them by pressing
        the &lt;v&gt; key. You can view individual attachments by selecting
        them and pressing the &lt;Enter&gt; key. To save an attachment to
        a file, press the &lt;s&gt; key.
      </para>

    <sect2 id="email-mutt-usage-sending">
      <title>Sending e-mails</title>

      <para>
        You can compose a new e-mail with the &lt;c&gt; key, or reply
        to a selected e-mail with the &lt;r&gt; key. Mutt will ask you
        to specify the recipient (<emphasis>To:</emphasis>), and a
        subject (<emphasis>Subject:</emphasis>). After entering this
        information an editor is launched (<command>vi</command> is used
        by default), which you can use to compose the e-mail. After saving
        the e-mail, and quitting the editor, mutt will give you the
        opportunity to make any changes to the e-mail. If you decide
        that you want to alter the e-mail, you can restart the editor
        with the &lt;e&gt; key. You can change the recipient or the
        subject with respectively &lt;t&gt; or &lt;s&gt;. Finally, you
        can send the e-mail by pressing &lt;y&gt;. If you would like to
        cancel the e-mail, press &lt;q&gt;. Mutt will ask you whether you
        want to postpone the e-mail. If you do so, you will be given the
        opportunity to re-do the e-mail the next time you compose a
        message.

  <sect1 id="email-mutt-basicsetup">
    <title>Basic setup</title>

    <para>
      There are a few mutt settings you often want to configure. This section
      describes these settings. User-specific mutt customizations can be made
      in the <filename>.muttrc</filename> in the user's home directory. You
      can change global mutt settings in <filename>/etc/mutt/Muttrc</filename>.
    </para>

    <sect2 id="email-mutt-basicsetup-headers">
      <title>Customized headers</title>

      <indexterm><primary>mutt</primary><secondary>headers</secondary></indexterm>

      <para>
        Each e-mail has headers with various information. For example, the
        header contains information about the path an e-mail has traversed
        after it has been sent. The sender (<emphasis>From:</emphasis>) and
        recipient (<emphasis>To:</emphasis>) e-mail addresses are also stored
        in the headers, as well as the subject (<emphasis>Subject:</emphasis>)
        of an e-mail. You can add your own headers to an e-mail with the
        <emphasis>my_hdr</emphasis> configuration option. This option
        has the following syntax: <emphasis>my_hdr &lt;header name&gt;:
        &lt;header contents&gt;</emphasis>. For example, you can add information
        about what OS you are running by adding the following line to your
        mutt configuration:
      </para>

      <screen>
my_hdr X-Operating-System: &Distribution; 10.1
      </screen>

      <para>
        You can also override some of the headers that are normally used,
        such as the sender address that is specified in the
        <emphasis>From:</emphasis> header:
      </para>

      <screen>
my_hdr From: John Doe &lt;john.doe@example.org&gt;
      </screen>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>The sendmail binary</title>

      <indexterm><primary>mutt</primary><secondary>sendmail binary</secondary></indexterm>

      <para>
        By default mutt uses the sendmail MTA to deliver e-mails that
        were sent. You can use another command to send e-mail by altering
        the <emphasis>sendmail</emphasis> configuration variable. The
        sendmail replacement must handle the same parameter syntax
        as sendmail. For example, if you have installed MSMTP to deliver
        e-mails, you can configure mutt to use it by adding the following
        line to your mutt configuration:
      </para>

      <screen>
set sendmail="/usr/bin/msmtp"
      </screen>

      <para>
        When you have completely replaced sendmail with another MTA, for
        instance Postfix, it is usually not needed to set this parameter,
        because most MTAs provide an alternative sendmail binary file.
