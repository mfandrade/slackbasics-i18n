<title>An introduction to Slackware Linux</title>

<sect1>
<title>What is Linux?</title>

<para>
Linux is a Unix-like kernel which is written by Linus Torvalds
and other developers, who communicate using the internet. Linux
runs on many different architectures, for example on many IA32, IA64,
Alpha, m68k, SPARC and PowerPC machines. The latest kernel and
more information can be found at:

</para>

<para>
Linux is often confused with the GNU/Linux system. Linux is only a
kernel, not a complete operating system. GNU/Linux consists of the
GNU operating system with the Linux kernel. Please read the following
section for a more detailed explanation of GNU/Linux.

<title>What is GNU/Linux?</title>

<para>
At the beginning of the eighties Richard Stallman started an ambitious
project with the goal to write a free Unix-like operating system. The
name of this system is GNU (GNU is Not Unix). At the beginning of the
nineties most important components of the GNU oparating system were
written, except for the kernel, which is still under development under
the name HURD. HURD consists of some servers which provide Unix-like
kernel functionality. In turn these servers run under the Mach microkernel.
At the beginning at the nineties the HURD team still had to wait till
the Mach sources were released as free software. In the meanwhile Linus
started filling the gap with the Linux kernel. GNU/Linux thus refers
to the GNU system running on the Linux kernel. Right now the HURD
kernel is also in a usable state and can be downloaded in the form
of the GNU/HURD operating system. The
<ulink url="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</ulink> project has even
developed a version of the GNU operating system which works with the
<ulink url="http://www.netbsd.org/">NetBSD</ulink> kernel. We should
call "Linux distributions" "GNU/Linux distributions", because GNU
is a substantial part of most distributions.

<title>What is Slackware Linux?</title>

<para>
Slackware Linux is a GNU/Linux distribution which is maintained and
developed by Patrick Volkerding. In contrast to many other distributions
Slackware adheres to the so-called KISS (keep it simple stupid) principle.
This means that Slackware does not have complex graphical tools for
configuring a system. For newbies this can be somwhat harsh, but it
provides more transperancy and flexibility. Besides that you will
get to learn GNU/Linux to the bones with Slackware Linux.
</para>

<para>
Another distinguishing aspect of Slackware Linux, that also "complies"
with the KISS principe is the Slackware package manager. Slackware does
not have complex package manager like RPM. Packages are normal tgz
(tar/gzip) files, mostly with an additional installation script and
a package description. Tgz is much more powerful than RPM for novice
users and avoids dependency problems. Another famous feature of Slackware
are the BSD-like initialization scripts of Slackware Linux. Slackware
has one initialization script for each runlevel insteas of a script
for eacht daemon. It allow you to tweak with your system easily,
without the need to write net init scripts yourself.
</para>

<para>
The packages in Slackware Linux are compiled with as little modifications
as possible. This means you can use most general GNU/Linux documentation.
</para>

<title>Slackware Linux on CD-ROM</title>
<para>
Slackware Linux can be purchased at quite many (internet) shops. It is
important to make a distinction between the official CD-ROM set and
cheap copies. When you buy the official CD set you are financially
supporting the development of Slackware Linux. So, if you would
like to see continuing development of Slackware Linux, buy the CD set!
