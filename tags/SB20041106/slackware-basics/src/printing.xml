<title>Introduction</title>

<para>
GNU/Linux supports a large share of the available USB, parallel and
network printers. Slackware Linux provides two printing systems,
CUPS and LPRNG. This chapter covers the CUPS system.
</para>

<para>
Independent of which printing system you are going to use, it is
a good idea to install some printer filter collections. These can
be found in the <quote>ap</quote> diskset. If you want to have
support for most printers, make sure the following packages are
installed:
</para>

<screen>
a2ps
enscript
espgs
gimp-print
gnu-gs-fonts
hpijs
ifhp
</screen>

<para>
Both printing systems have their own advantages and disadvantages. If
you do not have much experience with configuring printers under GNU/Linux,
it is a good idea to use CUPS, because CUPS provides a comfortable web
interface which can be accessed through a web browser.

<title>Preparations</title>

<para>
To be able to use cups the <quote>cups</quote> package from the
<quote>a</quote> diskset has to be installed. After the installation
CUPS can be started automatically during each system boot by making
<filename>/etc/rc.d/rc.cups</filename> executable. This can be
done with the following command:
</para>

<screen>
# <command>chmod a+x /etc/rc.d/rc.cups</command>
</screen>

<para>
After restarting the system CUPS will also be restarted automatically. You
can start CUPS on a running system by executing the following command:
</para>

<screen>
# <command>/etc/rc.d/rc.cups start</command>
</screen> 

</sect1>

<sect1>
<title>Configuration</title>

<para>
CUPS can be configured via a web interface. The configuration interface
can be accessed with a web browser at the following URL:
<ulink url="http://localhost:631/">http://localhost:631/</ulink>.
Some parts of the web interface require that you authenticate yourself.
If an authentication window pops up you can enter <quote>root</quote>
as the user name, and fill in the root account password.
</para>

<para>
A printer can be added to the CUPS configuration by clicking on
<quote>Administrate</quote>, and clicking on the <quote>Add Printer</quote>
button after that. The web interface will ask for three options:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
<emphasis>Name</emphasis> - the name of the printer. Use a simple
name, for example <quote>epson</quote>.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
<emphasis>Location</emphasis> - the physical location of the printer.
This setting is not crucial, but handy for larger organizations.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
<emphasis>Description</emphasis> - a description of the printer,
for example <quote>Epson Stylus Color C42UX</quote>.
</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist> 

<para>
You can proceed by clicking the <quote>Continue</quote> button. On
the next page you can configure how the printer is connected. If you
have an USB printer which is turned on, the web interface will show
the name of the printer next to the USB port that is used. After
configuring the printer port you can select the printer brand and
model. After that the printer configuration is finished, and the
printer will be added to the CUPS configuration.
</para>

<para>
An overview of the configured printers can be found on the
<quote>Printers</quote> page. On this page you can also do some
printer operations. For example, <quote>Print Test Page</quote>
can be used to check the printer configuration by printing a test
page.
</para>
